# Introduction
Heya chummer, welcome to the fold! We’re always willing to bring on new recruits in the digital war against those filthy Corpos, but there’s a few things you need to know before you get started…


Your greatest tool is your **Deck**- you’ll use it to run programs you’ve collected and to install modules for further customization. Your deck starts off with 10 preloaded *programs* that any decent hacktivist should call their own, and a single pre-installed *module* for that personal touch. As you take some turns finding dirt on the Corps, you’ll find a need to pick up some heavier lifters, luckily, I know just the place…

The **Black Market** will fulfill all your software and hardware needs. You’ll need the *Crypto* to pay for their goods, but they’ll always be stocked with the hottest tech. Also, if you don’t like what they’ve got for ya, you can always opt to *cycle* a selection if you don’t see anything to your fancy.


Once you’re done shopping and have a *grip* full of the hottest technofire, it’s time to hit the Corp’s **Server**. Each one is different and uses unique methods of defense, but with enough preparation and a little bit o’ luck you’ll *Dig* through the Corp’s defenses and find some sweet, juicy tidbits of *Data*.


When you manage that, congratulations! You’ve recovered a tiny encrypted puzzle piece that will be the first step to exposing the Corp’s **Schemes**! Alone it won’t mean much, but assign enough and you’ll break that Scheme to the public. Doing so will turn the Corps weapons against them, making your future runs even easier. Good thing to, as most Corps tend to get a bit touchier about their digital security after a Scheme or two are made public…


No worries though, your **Deck** has some protections built in if the Corp gets too close on your tail. If it takes too much *damage*, you’ll be forced to *reboot*. It’s annoying, I’ll give it that. You’ll need to reinstall any modules you’d had installed before, and you won’t be able to run as many programs due to startup lag, but it sure beats a real cold meat death.

Of course, there is one last tool that’s important for you to keep an eye on- the **Innovation** track. Too big to fail isn’t just a saying, it’s a reality. We bring in new blood because the fact of the matter is, we’re running out of time. As we do our work, the Corps do theirs, and if we can’t expose them before time runs out well… They win. Total Global Corporate ***Takeover***. 


But that won’t happen on our watch, will it? That’s why you’re here. That’s why we’re all here.


So take your best shot.
