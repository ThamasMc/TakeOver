# Corporation Decks

## What to See
Here you'll see the current and in-development **Corporation Decks** for use in TakeOver games.

Each Corporation Folder will contain the following resources:
  - A Server Folder
  - A Schemes Folder
  - An Actions Folder
  - A README introducing the concepts of that corporation.

Each folder will contain both a `.csv` file and a `.pdf` containing the data for the cards.

In my development, I plan out the card data within the `.csv` file and then use `nanDECK` as a means of generating `.pdf` files for prototyping.

## How to Use
If you'd like to playtest the game, you can print off the `.pdf` files located here to build your corporation decks.

For my playtest copy, I used magic cards reversed in their sleeves as backs that you can then slide the cut out TakeOver prototype card into.

Cards may change in shape or size in the future! This is still a work in progress.
